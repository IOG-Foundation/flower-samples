**Experimental Repository**  
Samples to scale Flower.ai simulations on a Ray Cluster

## Overview

This repository contains experimental examples demonstrating how to run Flower.ai simulations distributed across multiple nodes and GPUs.

First sample:

- Based on the [Flower quickstart PyTorch example](https://github.com/adap/flower/tree/96f996207da7e3147506e4be4fe374cb39243e28/examples/quickstart-pytorch)
